    <h1>freeCodeCamp Algorithms</h1>
    <p>
      freeCodeCamp is a great starting place for learning web development. I
      have personally gone through much of the cirriculum. One of the harder
      sections is the algorithm challenges. After I went through and solved
      them, I went back and made videos of my solutions. I hope that these can
      help other people going through the course who find themselves stuck
