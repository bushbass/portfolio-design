Hi, I'm Alex Nielsen.  I'm a self-taught web developer from NJ focusing on full stack javascript specifically with React and Node.
I learned some web development many years ago and have had many small personal sites over the years.  I've had a lot of different jobs and over the last couple years while I have been at home taking care of my young children, I began digging into modern web development.  
I've learned from all the usual suspects such as freecodecamp, codecadamey, and countless udemy courses.  Recently, I've had a couple freelance web development projects and I'm excited and ready to find a fulltime web development job.
Of course I have the building blocks of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  Additionaly I know some PHP and wordpress.  I use git and github for all my projects and you can check out most of my code there.  Besides hosting my occasional blog, My website alexnielsen.com has links to many projects with demos hosted on various platforms such as Netlify, heroku, vercel, and some old fashioned cpanel / ftp . Currently alexnielsen.com is built on Next js but an older version I built with Gatsby is still on alexnielsen.net
While I don't consider myself a designer, I have been using Photoshop for many years and know my way around there pretty well too.
I don't have a Computer science degree but I do have a BA in Music.  I have taught music for many years so my ideal job would be involving music or education but mostly I'd be happy to find a role where I can continue to improve my skills and keep pace with all the changes modern web development throws at us.
Thanks for taking the time to watch this and please feel free to contact me with questions, job offers, or any reason at all.
