    Link to github repo https://github.com/bushbass/hdGardenRecovery Link to
    demo https://hd-garden-recovery.netlify.app/ A single page React app to help
    with garden recovery at the big box hardware store. When I have to bring in
    20 or so pallets of various materials it's easy to lose track of how many of
    each I've brought in. This allows me to keep track with single button
    clicks. I will be adding user authentication next so it can be used by other
    associates in other stores. Skills: HTML | CSS | JavaScript | React Hosted
    on Netlify
